# Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Project-Portfolio
----------------------------------------------------
## This repository contains a collection of all project deliverables from my Data Analyst Nanodegree course work from Udacity.

## Project Deliverables Summary

1. Project 1 : Investigate a Dataset

  - Analysis of a kaggle dataset containing 100k medical appointments in Brazil.

  - The goal of the project was to investigate what factors caused patients not to show up for their medical appointments and 
document the analysis process along with visualizations to explain the findings and support the conclusions drawn.

Tool: Jupyter Notebook (Python)

#### Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Contents:   
  Investigate a Dataset.ipynb  
  Investigate a Dataset.html  
  noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv

2. Project 2 : Gather, Wrangle and Analyze Data

  - The goal of the project was to Gather data from different sources in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness,clean it and perform some analysis to generate insight. 
  - Document the gathering, wrangling, cleaning and analysis process along with visualizations in an ipynb.
  - Write a 300-600 word report describing the wrangling efforts  
  - Create a 250-word-minimum written report(blog post or magazine article) to communicate the insights and displays the visualization(s) from the wrangled data.  
 

**Data sources:**

WeRateDogs Twitter archive. This contains 5000+ basic tweet data about dog rating, name, and "stage"  
tweet image predictions from Udacity site. This file contains dog breed prediction results (from a Neural Network classifier) for every dog images from the WeRateDogs Twitter archive.  
Twitter API tweepy. Use this API to query additional data (in JSON format) for each tweet ID in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive.  

Tool: Jupyter Notebook (Python), VS Code

#### Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, tweepy, json, requests

Contents:

3. Project 3 : Data Visualization
  
  - The goal of this project was to perform wrangling operation on a dataset to extract a subset of relevant features, 
  and use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore the wrangled dataset,
  starting from univariate plots and building up to bivariate and multivariate plots
  - Produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships from the selected dataset, 
  primarily by transforming exploratory visualizations from the analysis into polished, explanatory visualizations.
  
Tool: Jupter Notebook (Python)
